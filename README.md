The code is based on the constitutive models described in these papers:
1) Grassl, Peter, Dimitrios Xenos, Ulrika Nyström, Rasmus Rempling, and Kent Gylltoft. "CDPM2: A damage-plasticity approach to modelling the failure of concrete." International Journal of Solids and Structures 50, no. 24 (2013): 3805-3816.
2) Grassl, Peter, and Milan Jirásek. "Damage-plastic model for concrete failure." International journal of solids and structures 43, no. 22-23 (2006): 7166-7196.
